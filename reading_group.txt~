* Non-negative matrix factorizations

  Dean comment that the constraint for a non-negativity is not
necessary (his claim).  The idea is that the interesting coordinates
in a principle components decomposition are those that emerge beyond
the 'fog' of random variation.  Think of the pointy graphite pencil
ball.  The pencil-points represent meaningful coordinates; the others
in the ball are random variation.

  Imagine doing a histogram of the coordinates/direction given by PC.
Only those that are outliers in the histogram that extend beyond the
noise level are meaningful.
